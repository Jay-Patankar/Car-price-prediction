This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using Machine learning algorithms . 
The dataset has been borrowed from kaggle.
The project uses sklearn as the primary library for preprocessing and to build models.
The data visualization has been done using seaborn , plotly and matplotlib.
The raw data has been split into training data , validation data and test data.
Two models have been build viz a Linear regression model and a Decision - Tree model.
The Decision Tree model when build with the best tunned inputs offers nice  results with R2 score as 0.957.
